=== bb.edn

Since version 0.3.1, babashka supports a local `bb.edn` file to manage a project.

=== :paths and :deps

You can declare one or multiple paths and dependencies so they are automatically
added to the classpath:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["script"]
 :deps {medley/medley {:mvn/version "1.3.0"}}}
----

If we have a project that has a deps.edn and would like to reuse those deps in bb.edn:

[source, clojure]
----
{:deps {local/deps {:local/root "."}}}
----

If we have a main function in a file called `script/my_project/main.clj` like:

----
(ns my-project.main
  (:require [medley.core :as m]))

(defn -main [& _args]
  (prn (m/index-by :id [{:id 1} {:id 2}])))
----

we can invoke it like:

[source,clojure]
----
$ bb -m my-project.main
{1 {:id 1}, 2 {:id 2}}
----

See <<main-function>> for more details on how to invoke a function from the command line.

The `:deps` entry is managed by https://github.com/borkdude/deps.clj[deps.clj]
and requires a `java` installation to resolve and download dependencies.

=== :min-bb-version

Since version 0.3.6, babashka supports the `:min-bb-version` where the minimal
babashka version can be declared:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["src"]
 :deps {medley/medley {:mvn/version "1.3.0"}}
 :min-bb-version "0.3.7"}
----

When using an older bb version (that supports `:min-bb-version`), babashka will
print a warning:

[source]
----
WARNING: this project requires babashka 0.3.7 or newer, but you have: 0.3.6
----

=== :tasks

Since babashka 0.4.0 the `bb.edn` file supports the `:tasks` entry which
describes tasks that you can run in the current project. The tasks feature is
similar to what people use `Makefile`, `Justfile` or `npm run` for. See <<tasks>> for more details.
