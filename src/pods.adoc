== Pods

Pods are programs that can be used as a Clojure library by
babashka. Documentation is available in the
https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods[library repo].

A list of available pods can be found
https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/blob/master/doc/projects.md#pods[here].

=== Pod registry

Since bb 0.2.6 pods can be obtained via the https://github.com/babashka/pod-registry[pod-registry].

This is an example script which uses
https://github.com/retrogradeorbit/bootleg[bootleg] as a pod to convert hiccup
to HTML.

[source,clojure]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bb

(require '[babashka.pods :as pods])

(pods/load-pod 'retrogradeorbit/bootleg "0.1.9")

(require '[pod.retrogradeorbit.bootleg.utils :as utils])

(-> [:div
     [:h1 "Using Bootleg From Babashka"]
     [:p "This is a demo"]]
    (utils/convert-to :html))

=== Pods in bb.edn

Since bb 0.8.0 pods can be declared in `bb.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["bb"]
 :pods {org.babashka/go-sqlite3 {:version "0.1.0"}}}
----

Given the file `bb/my_project/db.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-project.db
  (:require [pod.babashka.go-sqlite3 :as sqlite]))

(defn -main [& _args]
  (prn (sqlite/query ":memory:" ["SELECT 1 + 1 AS sum"])))
----

you can then execute the main function, without calling `load-pod` manually:

[source,shell]
----
$ bb -m my-project.db
[{:sum 2}]
----
