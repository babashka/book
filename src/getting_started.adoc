== Getting started

=== Installation

Installing babashka is as simple as downloading the binary for your platform and
placing it on your path. Pre-built binaries are provided on the
https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases[releases] page of babashka's
https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[Github repo]. Babashka is also available in
various package managers like `brew` for macOS and linux and `scoop` for
Windows. See https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#installation[here] for
details.

=== Building from source

If you would rather build babashka from source, download a copy of GraalVM and
set the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable. Also make sure you have
https://leiningen.org[lein] installed. Then run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/borkdude/babashka --recursive
$ script/uberjar && script/compile
```

See the babashka https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/blob/master/doc/build.md[build.md] page for details.

=== Running babashka

The babashka executable is called `bb`. You can either provide it with a Clojure
expression directly:

[source,clojure]
----
$ bb -e '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
----

or run a script:

.script.clj
[source,clojure]
----
(println (+ 1 2 3))
----

[source,clojure]
----
$ bb -f script.clj
6
----

The `-e` flag is optional when the argument starts with a paren. In that case babashka will treat it automatically as an expression:

[source,clojure]
----
$ bb '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
----

Similarly, the `-f` flag is optional when the argument is a filename:

[source,clojure]
----
$ bb script.clj
6
----

Commonly, scripts have shebangs so you can invoke them with their filename only:

.script.clj
[source,clojure]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bb
(println (+ 1 2 3))
----
