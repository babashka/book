== Child processes

by Michiel Borkent

There are several ways of creating child processes in babashka. Let's start with
the easiest one.

=== clojure.java.shell

A common way to shell out to another process is via `clojure.java.shell`:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.java.shell :refer [sh]])
nil
user=> (sh "ls")
{:exit 0, :out "README.md\ndist\ngh-pages\nscript\nsrc\n", :err ""}
----

As you can see the result of `:out` are the lines of text produced by `ls`. The
`:exit` code was `0` and there was no output on stderr.

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (sh "ls" "foo")
{:exit 1, :out "", :err "ls: foo: No such file or directory\n"}
----

If we invoke `ls` with a non-existing file, there is error output, but not
output on stdout and the `:exit` code is `1`.

For more information on `clojure.java.shell`, read the
https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.java.shell-api.html[API documentation]

=== babashka.process

Creating a child process with `clojure.java.shell/sh` is convenient and
sufficient in 90% of the scripts you're going to write with babashka. For the
remaining 10% you're going to need something slightly more powerful. This is
where the `babashka.process` library namespace comes in. The README and source
code of this library is located https://github.com/babashka/process[here].

What if we wanted to start a Clojure pREPL in our script, send commands to it
and read the evaluated output in a loop?  Using `clojure.java.shell/sh` for this
has the limitation that we can only send input and read output once per process.
Using `babashka.process` which leverages the `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` and
`java.lang.Process` classes gives us the extra power we need to overcome this
limitation.

First we show how to use `process` to start a process that inherits stdout,
stderr and stdin from the parent process. This is often useful when you want to
hand over control to another process at the end of a script. The following code
starts a pREPL process:

.process/prepl_1.clj
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$/process/prepl_1.clj[]
----

<1> The command and its arguments

<2> Creating the process

<3> This option redirects stdout and stdin from the parent process to the child
process.

<4> This line will destroy the child process and all of it's children processes
before the parent process exits.

<5> Dereferencing the process waits until it ends. If
we would not include this, our script would end immediately.

When calling the script, we can interact with the pREPL

[source,shell]
----
$ bb src/process/prepl_1.clj
(+ 1 2 3)
{:tag :ret, :val "6", :ns "user", :ms 5, :form "(+ 1 2 3)"}
----

Pressing ctrl-C or typing `:repl/quit` will make the script terminate.

What if we want to parse the output of the prepl and reformat it to our own
likings?  Instead of sending the output of the child process to stdout we will
have to get a hold of it. We can grab the output by not using `:inherit` and
getting the `:out` stream of the process. Similarly we will grab the `:in`
stream of the process and handle reading ourselves.

.process/prepl_2.clj
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$process/prepl_2.clj[]
----

<1> A writer that we will use to send input to the pREPL

<2> A reader that reads from the pREPL output. pREPL returns EDN and
`clojure.edn/read` needs a `PushbackReader`.

<3> We read user input via `clojure.core/read-line`

<4> Here we binding `*out*` to the input writer so we can use `println` to write
to it.

<5> Read the next EDN value.

<6> Print the output using our custom formatting.

Here is an example run:

[source,shell]
----
$ bb src/process/prepl_2.clj
Type an expression to evaluate:
(+ 1 2 3)
(+ 1 2 3) evaluates to 6
:repl/quit
----

==== Real world examples

Prior to `babashka.process` people were using raw `ProcessBuilder` interop. Here are some real world examples. These might get updated to `babashka.process` in the future.

* The https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/blob/5608f935cd28c777cf7d16243574558e2203872e/script/bump_version.clj#L9[babashka] repo uses `ProcessBuilder` to invoke git to make a commit after bumping the version.
  It redirects the output from `git` directly to stdout of the parent process.
* https://github.com/borkdude/babashka.curl/blob/53b5b9d98f2e594384f628b0deee76b53bea5062/src/babashka/curl.clj#L17[babashka.curl] uses `ProcessBuilder` to interact with the `curl` executable
* https://github.com/borkdude/deps.clj/blob/5d51b80176bdcb96927ce5e6aedb25581db0e2e0/deps.clj#L18[deps.clj]
  uses `ProcessBuilder` to interact with `java`, e.g. to start a Clojure REPL or
  compute a classpath using tools.deps
