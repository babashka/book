=== Running tests

Babashka bundles `clojure.test`. To run tests you can write a test runner script. Given the following project structure:

[source,shell]
----
.
├── src
│   └──...
└── test
    └── your
        ├── test_a.clj
        └── test_b.clj
----

.test-runner.clj
[source,clojure]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bb

(require '[clojure.test :as t]
         '[babashka.classpath :as cp])

(cp/add-classpath "src:test")                        ;; <1>

(require 'your.test-a 'your.test-b)                  ;; <2>

(def test-results
  (t/run-tests 'your.test-a 'your.test-b))           ;; <3>

(let [{:keys [fail error]} test-results]
  (when (pos? (+ fail error))
    (System/exit 1)))                                ;; <4>
----

<1> Add sources and tests to the classpath
<2> Require the test namespaces
<3> Run all tests in the test namespaces
<4> Exit the test script with a non-zero exit code when there are failures or errors

[[main_file]]
=== Main file

In Python scripts there is a well-known pattern to check if the current
file was the file invoked from the command line, or loaded from another
file: the `__name__ == "__main__"` pattern. In babashka this pattern can
be implemented with:

[source,clojure]
----
(= *file* (System/getProperty "babashka.file"))
----

Combining this with a conditional invocation of `-main` creates a script file that is safe to load at a REPL, and easy to invoke at the CLI.

[source,clojure]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bb

;; Various functions defined here

(defn -main [& args]
;; Implementation of main
)

(when (= *file* (System/getProperty "babashka.file"))
  (apply -main *command-line-args*))
----

This can be exceedingly handy for editing complex scripts interactively, while not being able to adjust how they are invoked by other tools.

=== Shutdown hook

Adding a shutdown hook allows you to execute some code before the script
exits.

[source,clojure]
----
$ bb -e '(-> (Runtime/getRuntime) (.addShutdownHook (Thread. #(println "bye"))))'
bye
----

This also works when the script is interrupted with ctrl-c.

=== Printing returned values

Babashka doesn't print a returned `nil` as lots of scripts end in
something side-effecting.

[source,shell]
----
$ bb -e '(:a {:a 5})'
5
$ bb -e '(:b {:a 5})'
$
----

If you really want to print the nil, you can use `(prn ..)` instead.

==== HTTP over Unix sockets

This can be useful for talking to Docker:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.java.shell :refer [sh]])
(require '[cheshire.core :as json])
(-> (sh "curl" "--silent"
        "--no-buffer" "--unix-socket"
        "/var/run/docker.sock"
        "http://localhost/images/json")
    :out
    (json/parse-string true)
    first
    :RepoTags) ;;=> ["borkdude/babashka:latest"]
----

[[core_async]]
=== Core.async

In addition to `future`, `pmap`, `promise` and friends, you may use the
`clojure.core.async` namespace for asynchronous scripting. The following
example shows how to get first available value from two different
processes:

[source,clojure]
----
bb -e '
(defn async-command [& args]
  (async/thread (apply shell/sh "bash" "-c" args)))

(-> (async/alts!! [(async-command "sleep 2 && echo process 1")
                   (async-command "sleep 1 && echo process 2")])
    first :out str/trim println)'
process 2
----

Caveat: currently the `go` macro is available for compatibility with JVM
programs, but the implementation maps to `clojure.core.async/thread` and
the single exclamation mark operations (`<!`, `>!`, etc.) map to the
double exclamation mark operations (`<!!`, `>!!`, etc.). It will not
"park" threads, like on the JVM.

Examples like the following may still work, but will take a lot more
system resources than on the JVM and will break down for some high value
of `n`:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.core.async :as async])

(def n 1000)

(let [cs (repeatedly n async/chan)
      begin (System/currentTimeMillis)]
  (doseq [c cs] (async/go (async/>! c "hi")))
  (dotimes [_ n]
    (let [[v _] (async/alts!! cs)]
      (assert (= "hi" v))))
  (println "Read" n "msgs in" (- (System/currentTimeMillis) begin) "ms"))
----

=== Interacting with an nREPL server

Babashka comes with the https://github.com/nrepl/bencode[nrepl/bencode]
library which allows you to read and write bencode messages to a socket.
A simple example which evaluates a Clojure expression on an nREPL server
started with `lein repl`:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns nrepl-client
  (:require [bencode.core :as b]))

(defn nrepl-eval [port expr]
  (let [s (java.net.Socket. "localhost" port)
        out (.getOutputStream s)
        in (java.io.PushbackInputStream. (.getInputStream s))
        _ (b/write-bencode out {"op" "eval" "code" expr})
        bytes (get (b/read-bencode in) "value")]
    (String. bytes)))

(nrepl-eval 52054 "(+ 1 2 3)") ;;=> "6"
----

Note that the above is a bit low level. You can also use the
https://github.com/babashka/nrepl-client[nrepl-client] library for this.

=== Running from Cygwin/Git Bash

On Windows, `bb` can be invoked from the bash shell directly:

[source,shell]
----
$ bb -e '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
----

However, creating a script that invokes `bb` via a shebang leads to an error if
the script is not in the current directory. Suppose you had the following script
named `hello` on your path:

[source,clojure]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bb
(println "Hello, world!")
----

[source,shell]
----
$ hello
----- Error --------------------------------------------------------------------
Type:     java.lang.Exception
Message:  File does not exist: /cygdrive/c/path/to/hello
----

The problem here is that the shell is passing a Cygwin-style path to `bb`, but
`bb` can't recognize it because it wasn't compiled with Cygwin.

The solution is to create a wrapper script that converts the Cygwin-style path
to a Windows-style path before invoking `bb`. Put the following into a script
called `bbwrap` somewhere on your Cygwin path, say in `/usr/local/bin/bbwrap`:

[source,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPT=$1
shift
bb.exe $(cygpath -w $SCRIPT) $@
----

Make sure to fix your original script to invoke `bbwrap` instead of `bb`
directly:

[source,clojure]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bbwrap
(println "Hello, world!")
----

=== Throwing exception to exit program

Babashka supports adding `:babashka/exit` metadata to an `ex-info` to indicate
the exit code of babashka when this exception isn't caught by any other parts of
the program. The `:babashka/exit` code also indicates that no error report should be printed.


[source,shell]
---
$ bb -e '(throw (ex-info "Error happened" {:babashka/exit 1}))'
Error happened
$ echo $?
1
---
