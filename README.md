## Build

For a single compile:
```shell
$ bb script/compile.clj
```

To watch and automatically update in a chrome:
```shell
% bb watch
```

This uses `asciidoctor` to spit out an HTML file into the `gh-pages` directory.
To install `asciidoctor`, check the documentation [here](https://asciidoctor.org/).
You also need to install the ruby rouge gem if you want syntax highlighting to work locally. 
The `bb watch` task requires `chromedriver` to be installed, download a version that matches your browser version [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable).

## Release

Files produced by asciidoctor are hosted on Github. This is set up like
described
[here](https://medium.com/linagora-engineering/deploying-your-js-app-to-github-pages-the-easy-way-or-not-1ef8c48424b7):

All the commands below assume that you already have a git project initialized and that you are in its root folder.

```
# Create an orphan branch named gh-pages
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
# Remove all files from staging
git rm -rf .
# Create an empty commit so that you will be able to push on the branch next
git commit --allow-empty -m "Init empty branch"
# Push the branch
git push origin gh-pages
```

Now that the branch is created and pushed to origin, let’s configure the
worktree correctly.

```
# Come back to master
git checkout master
# Add gh-pages to .gitignore
echo "gh-pages/" >> .gitignore
git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
```

That’s it, you can now build your app as usual with npm run build . If you cd to
the gh-pages folder, you will notice that you are now in the gh-pages branch and if
you go back to the root folder, you will go back to master .

To deploy to Github Pages:

```
cd gh-pages
git add .
git commit -m "update build"
git push
```

After cloning this repo to a new dir/computer:

``` shell
git fetch origin gh-pages
git worktree prune
git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
```
